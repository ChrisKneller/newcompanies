# New Companies

A project to practice the development and implementation of a RESTful API using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy connecting to a remote PostgreSQL database.

The final project should allow users to find all UK companies incorporated on the current day, something which is not available via Companies House (they only release this data once a month). The idea is to also allow searching by incorporation date, postcode and other methods currently not supported by Companies House.
